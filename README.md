This is my Dissertation that I completed for my bachelor's degree

Subject:
Data-driven approaches to creating optimal energy consumption policies for multi-function print devices

Aim: 
Investigate how the use of data analyses can be used to create an optimal energy consumption
policy that balances energy-performance trade-off.

Reason:
In ICT systems energy is wasted when a device is left on and not in use. To combat this
most devices, have an energy consumption policy put in place that helps by switching the device to
an ideal energy-saving state when not in use. However, most polices are programmed for static use
and donâ€™t account for device high and low usage peaks meaning they will be un-optimal at certain
times. Printers are an example of one these devices and when printing is 10-16% of ICT related
energy consumption in higher education [9], the small amount of wasted per device starts to add up

Note:
For reasons I am unable to link the code that i used as it is private data that I have been given for this task.
A simulation was also built to create this disertation however it was based off a private bit of code made by my supervisior so I have been asked not to include it.
